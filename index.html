        <p>
          I've been learning and practicting couple programming languages for

          <li>C#</li>

      <li>
        <h3>Mathematics</h3>
        <p>
          I was always good at maths at school. I used to give private classes
          to some of mine elementary school friends, as well as compete at some
          of the regional school competitions. The main reason I always liked
          math is the fact that I like solving logical problems and riddles.
