        <h2>Watching anime / Reading mangas</h2>
        <p>
          I've started watching anime when I was 9 if I recall correctly. The
          first anime I ever watched was Naruto, it got me into the world of
          anime. I've watched all different sorts of anime genres up to this
          point, with the entire number of titles being around 40. My all-time
          favourites include: Death Note, Berserk and Monster
